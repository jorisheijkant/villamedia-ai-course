## Villamedia AI course
In this repository you can find all the code that was used to gather data and do some basic analysis on the different projects in the Villamedia AI course. 

### Installation
All the code is written in Python, version 3. To install all the dependencies, one can use the ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` command. N.b.: since this repo is a bit of a mess, it might be that some dependencies are not listed in the requirements.txt file. If you get an error, just install the missing dependency using pip. Look at the start of each script to see what the dependencies are.
